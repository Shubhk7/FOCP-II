        --> protected ->it means the derived class will have acess to protected members of parent class
                            protected data is accessible to derived class, but inaccessible outer world. while private data inaccessible to derived class also


:: is the Scope Resolution operator and is used to tell the scope of particular function which means that you are telling to the compiler that getData function belongs to the class add
if we are defining the function within the class then there is no need to use the scope Resolution operator
class is a userdefined datatype because class is the collection of similar type of Objects.
