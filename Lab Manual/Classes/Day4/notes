there are 2 ways to define a class and its function :
            --> We can declare the class which consists of data members and member functions.
                the member function are defined outside the by using scope resolution operator 
            --> We can define the class by declaring data members and member functions inside the class 
                the member functions are also defined inside the class
                in this method we do not need the scope resolution operator

**In C and C++ executions of a progam starts with main function
